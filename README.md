# ep_timeslider
I extracted the timeslider of [Etherpad-Lite](https://github.com/Pita/etherpad-lite) and converted it into a plugin.
This plugin will add a timeslider button in your right toolbar. A click on this button dynamically loads a fully functional timeslider on the same page.

## Install
In your etherpad-lite root directory run

```
npm install git+https://github.com/marcelklehr/ep_timeslider.git
```

## Feedback
Feedback is greatly appreciated [here](https://github.com/marcelklehr/ep_timeslider/issues)

## Known issues
 1. There's no going back (yet). Once you have the timeslider you cannot close or remove it in any way, at the moment..
